                is a cue sport that originated in India in the latter half of the 19th century.
                The game is played on a rectangular table covered with green baize, with pockets at each
                of the four corners and in the middle of each long side. Players use a cue stick to pocket
                colored balls into the pockets, aiming to score points and outmaneuver their opponents.
                Snooker has become a popular and competitive sport worldwide, attracting enthusiasts from
                all walks of life.

            <h4 style="margin-top: 40px;">For the fellow nerds</h4>
            <p>
                These specific formulae are intended to fix a few potential issues with the 
                drawing of the cup-stages, for any sport, where there is prelimenary seeding and multiple qualifiers 
                from groups. There are no alterations in this model for the group winners in any of the draw-formulae; 
                they all still follow the principle of "highest seed meets lowest seed" - or equivalently: the principle 
                of equal sum (i.e. for each round all the matches, assuming the expected result by seeding, 
                will involve players whose seeding add up to the 
                same number (e.g. in the quarter final stages: 1-8, 4-5, 3-6, 2-7 all up to 9)). 
            </p>
            <p>
                The only difference between the formats are the initial placement of the remaining qualifiers in the 
                draw. The most prominent issue is that players from the same group should not be able to meet again 
                before a potential final. 
                We would of course like to chose an appropriate algorithm for the draw - and the main criteria should hence 
                be the principle of "highest seed meets lowest seed" (see above), which obviously doesn't work because 
                they (e.g. seed 1 and seed 16) will have played in the same group. 
                This leaves, in general, a total of (<em># of Qualifiers / 4</em>)! possible draws to choose from. 
                The obvious next step is to place 
                all the 2nd-place finishers by "mirroring" the draw of the 1st-place finishers (e.g. for 8 groups and 16 
                qualifiers: A1(1)-H2(15), B1(8)-G2(9), ... , H1(2)-A2(16)) ensuring that players from the same group end up 
                in different halfs while also optimizing with regards to the principle of equal sum. This method works well 
                enough, but there are 
                some potential problems with it: if for example the 1st or 2nd seed have a slight slip-up in the group 
                stages they will clash immediately in the first(!) knock-out match. One might argue that, in that case, it's 
                deserved and the seeds shouldn't be over-protected - but after a trial of one year of this system it has been 
                decided to try another, more elegant method (note: this method is also problematic because of the 
                unfortunate fate of the 16th, 15th, 8th and 7th seed: you will see that these players will face tremendous 
                and unreasonable difficulty in their efforts to climb up the rankings and improve their seeding). 
            </p>
            <p>
                Which brings us to the method in hand: the norwegian snooker community have decided to use a method for 
                calculating the draw based on a principle I have dubbed "recursive mirroring" for the forseeable future. 
                We wanted an elegant, mathematically rigorous model that didn't infringe on the fairness of the 
                competition or seem unnaturally constructed - and among the many different possible paradigms of 
                principle for the calculation of the draw - this is the method we landed on. 
                As mentioned earlier, the draw for the group winners remains unchanged, while the 2nd-place finishers 
                (where applicable) follow the principle of "mirroring" as described above. The 2nd place of the first 
                group will meet the winner of the last group, the 2nd place of the second group will meet the winner 
                of the penultimate group and so on. And now mirror the draw of the 2nd-place finishers again within 
                each half of the draw, and then again by halving and mirroring again and continue <em>recursively</em>. 
                Thus we have created a fair an elegant solution to the calculation of the draw for the knock-out stages 
                - or at least laid the basis for a general principle to use as a guideline for the individual formats.

            <h3 id="section-HC">HC-rating</h3>
            <p>
                This model is an extension of the industry standard 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system" class="hyperlink" target="_blank">ELO-model</a>
                for calculating playing strength 
                and generating a rating list.The idea emanated from the need to evaluate the handicap (HC)
                between two players in the game of snooker. Fortunatly, we already have access to a 
                <a href="https://cuescore.com/nb/ratings" class="hyperlink" target="_blank">rating list</a>
                provided by the NBF (ELO-model with rating delta normalization factor 400 and K-factor 20) - from
                there it's just a matter of estimating a formula for calculating the HC based on the relative
                rating. This allows you the option of playing with, without or even with customized HC while
                maintaining the intergrity and true equilibrium of the model. Because of the intrinsic
                complexities of the game of snooker there is no rigorous way of determining this formula - hence
                I have tried to use my experience and knowledge to come up with an elegant solution:
            </p>
            <p>
                $${ HC = HC_{max} (1 - e^{- ( | \Delta r | / b ) ^a});  \;\;\;\; 
                \mathscr{where:} \;\;  \Delta r = \mathscr{rating} \; \mathscr{delta} ,\;HC_{max} = 147,\; a = 1,\; b = 1400. }$$
            </p>
            <h4>How To Apply</h4>
            <p>
                Hopefully the interface is pretty self explanetary, however there are a few things you should note - 
                particularly perteining to the match protocol:
                
            </p>
            <ul style="margin-bottom: 80px; font-family: Exo, sans-serif;">
                <li>You can't edit a match after it is finished.</li>
                <li>Positive HC means player B starts with extra points and negative HC means player A gets a head 
                    start. Denoted by number of points granted at the start of each frame, in parenthesis, behind the 
                    player's name in the match display.
                </li>
                <li>Please consider your spelling carefully when typing out player names.</li>
                <li>
                    When creating a new match you can choose whether to play a specific distance or just playing 
                    a non-specified number of frames (free-frames).
                </li>
                <li>Please note that matches of longer distances weigh slightly heavier when updating rating.</li>
                <li>
                    Update-rating-by-system (URS) refers to whether you want, opun completion of match, to update 
                    rating by match outcome (win-lose-draw) or by frame score (i.e. a match finished 4-3 when the
                    expected outcome was closer to 4-2 will actually result in an increase of the losing player's
                    rating - like in chess); the "match"-option weighs slightly heavier than the "frames"-option.
                </li>
                <li>Update the score and other parameters of a match by clicking the "edit"-button 
                    (which you can find within the expandable part of the match display).</li>
            </ul>
